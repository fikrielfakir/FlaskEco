# Overview

EcoQuality is a comprehensive quality management system specifically designed for ceramic tile manufacturing facilities. The application provides end-to-end production tracking, quality control testing, energy monitoring, and waste management capabilities. Built with Flask and SQLAlchemy, the system focuses on ISO compliance (particularly ISO 13006 for ceramic tiles), environmental sustainability, and production efficiency. The application supports role-based access for operators, supervisors, and quality technicians to manage ceramic production workflows from raw materials to finished products.
