1. Core Standards to Implement

Your app should align with ISO 10545 test methods and ISO 13006 classification.

Test Type	ISO Standard	What It Measures	Relevance
Dimensional Check	ISO 10545-2	Length, width, thickness, straightness, flatness, rectangularity	Ensures tile size & shape uniformity
Water Absorption	ISO 10545-3	% water absorbed (porosity)	Classifies tiles (porcelain <0.5%, stoneware, earthenware, etc.)
Breaking Strength / Flexural Resistance	ISO 10545-4	Resistance to rupture under 3-point bending	Guarantees mechanical strength
Abrasion Resistance	ISO 10545-6 / 7	Surface wear (glazed tiles), volume loss (unglazed)	Durability & surface lifetime

⚠️ NM ISO 13006 (Morocco): This national standard uses ISO 10545 tests as references and specifies classification + marking rules.

2. Tile Classification (ISO 13006 / NM ISO 13006)

Tiles are classified by:

Water absorption groups (A, B, C)

Group BIa: Porcelain (≤0.5% absorption)

Group BIIa: Stoneware (0.5%–3%)

Group BIII: Earthenware (>10%)

Forming method: Pressed (B) or Extruded (A)

Glazed or Unglazed

👉 Example: BIa, glazed = Porcelain glazed floor tile.

3. What Your App Should Handle

A Quality Control App for Ceramic Tiles can include modules like:

🔹 1. Sample Management

Register batch, production line, operator

Assign sample IDs

Track production date & lot number

🔹 2. Test Execution

For each sample:

Input dimensional measurements (mm, tolerances auto-checked)

Record water absorption test results (% value)

Input rupture test force (calculate flexural strength automatically)

Record abrasion class (ISO test cycles / volume loss)

🔹 3. Automatic Calculations

Auto-check against ISO tolerances

Assign tile classification (e.g., BIa, BIIb, BIII)

Pass/Fail decision

🔹 4. Reporting & Analytics

Export results (PDF / Excel)

Generate batch conformity certificates

Track defect trends by line, date, material supplier

🔹 5. Integration

Barcode / QR Code for each batch

Possible IoT sensor input (digital calipers, load cells)

Dashboard with KPIs: rejection rate, avg absorption, avg strength

4. Typical Test Parameters (Example Values)

Here are some tolerances from ISO 10545 & ISO 13006 that your app can integrate:

Property	Typical Requirement (Porcelain – BIa)
Length/Width Tolerance	±0.6% (max 2.0 mm)
Thickness Tolerance	±5.0%
Straightness / Flatness	±0.5%
Water Absorption	≤ 0.5%
Breaking Strength	≥ 1300 N
Flexural Strength	≥ 35 N/mm²
Abrasion Resistance	Class PEI I–V (glazed)
5. User Workflow Example in App

Operator scans batch code

App prompts: “Enter 10 sample measurements for length”

App auto-calculates average, min, max, tolerance compliance

App asks for water absorption data → computes %

App asks for rupture test data → calculates flexural strength

App outputs: Conform / Non-Conform

Generate PDF report + store in database
